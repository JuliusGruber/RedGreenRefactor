# RedGreenRefactor

A CLI tool that automates Test-Driven Development using multiple Claude AI agents. It orchestrates the red-green-refactor cycle by coordinating four independent agents: one plans and selects tests, one writes failing tests, one implements minimal code to pass them, and one refactors—repeating until your feature is complete.
