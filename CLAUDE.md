## Project Overview

RedGreenRefactor is a project for practicing Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.

## TDD Workflow

Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test first
2. **Green**: Write the minimum code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests passing

## Development Guidelines

- Always write tests before implementation code
- Keep tests small and focused on a single behavior
- Run tests frequently to verify changes
- Commit after each successful Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior

## Commands

```bash
# Run tests (add actual test command when test framework is set up)
npm test
```
